# Upboat

*What is it?*
Upboat is a file and link sharing service which allows people
to upvote and downvote submissions similar to reddit or hackernews.

*How do I run it?*
Run it on a localhost using the standard WEBrick server after installing
the appropriate bundle.

*What's the difference between this and reddit or HN?*
I want to push it a bit futher to have it end up focused on a particular type
of content rather than simple link sharing, but this is only the start.
